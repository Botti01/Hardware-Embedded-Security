# Hardware and Embedded Security

## Course Overview

This repository hosts a range of exercises and lab assignments for the Hardware and Embedded Security course at @polito. The course provides a comprehensive dive into modern hardware security, tackling subjects such as VLSI design, intellectual property protection, hardware trust, and various attack strategies along with their countermeasures. By blending theoretical foundations with practical implementations, students gain valuable experience in fortifying embedded systems against real-world threats.

## Repository Contents

Within this repository, you will discover design code and project implementations that were developed during laboratory sessions. The primary focus is on crafting secure hardware designs using:

- **Verilog**
- **VHDL**

These projects aim to consolidate the security concepts discussed during the course and offer practical exposure to defending hardware components from emerging vulnerabilities.
